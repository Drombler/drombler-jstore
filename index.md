_Under Construction_


_Drombler JStore_ (working title) is the emerging next generation, cross-platform application store.

Drombler JStore provides first class support for Java applications and especially targets the post-Java 11 era.

For this purpose Drombler JStore also manages the following native components:
* JRE: There are RESTful services to discover new JRE update versions and download JREs for your target platform.
* JavaFX (possibly supported in the future)
